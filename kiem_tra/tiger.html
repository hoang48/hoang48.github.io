	<h1>Tiger</h1>
	<h2>Habitat loss</h2>
	<p>Tigers have lost 93% of their historical range. Their habitat has been destroyed, degraded and fragmented by human activities. The clearing of forests for agriculture and timber, as well as the building of road networks and other development activities, pose serious threats to tiger habitats. Tigers need wide swaths of habitat for their survival since they are very territorial. Fewer tigers can survive in small, scattered islands of habitat, which leads to a higher risk of inbreeding and makes tigers more vulnerable to poaching as they venture beyond protected areas to establish their own territories.</p>
	<h2>Human Wildlife Conflict</h2>
	<p>People and tigers increasingly compete for space. As forests shrink and prey gets scarce, tigers are forced to disperse beyond protected areas in search of their own territories. This takes them into human-dominated areas that lie between habitat fragments, where they hunt domestic livestock that many local communities depend on for their livelihood. In retaliation, tigers are killed or captured. “Conflict” tigers are known to end up for sale in black markets. Local community dependence on forests for fuelwood, food and timber heightens the risk of tiger attacks on people.</p>
